# Pseudocode

-will have to create a game container using a div
-within this container two more divs need to be placed, ground and flying block
-place the flyer in a sensible postion around the middle of the container 
-simulate gravity by creating a variable that will be altered continuously over time 
-create jump by an eventlistener and alter position of flyer

-the flyer will appear to stay static as this would make code easier
-instead generate moving tubes
-tubes should be of a set height with ranging positions and overflow hidden (also making code easier by this method)
